# This file enumarates the various third party libraries Toolkit uses for unit testing.
# Used to run tests
unittest2==1.1.0

# Use to temporarily replace part of the API or mock return values.
mock==2.0.0

# When pip installing the mock module, it also installs the pbr module.
# The pbr module has a depdendency on the setuptools module. The reason
# why we are listing it here is that when we pip install the requirements
# from this file, setuptools is already installed with python, which means
# it won't be copied to this repo. By specifying it here, it forces
# this specific version to be installed in tests/python/third_party.
setuptools==36.0.1
